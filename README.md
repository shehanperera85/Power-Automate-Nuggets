# power-automate-nuggets
This repo contains Power Automate nuggets that can ease your Microsoft 365 tasks.

I’m considered as a citizen developer and I know the ways to get some automation happening when it needed the most. This is one of them. This has been in my head for a while and I’ve seen this happening many times. So thought to do some findings, playing around with the tools to come up with some automation.

As MS Graph can do if you keen to go in that rabbit hole and once it’s combined with Power Automate? Magic. Well not really, but you can automate workflows and proven to be a must have set of tools in the Admin’s toolbox. I will be using MS Graph and Power Automate for this scenario and will be using Microsoft Teams Flow Bot to notify the admin.
