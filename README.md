# Power Automate Nuggets

This repo contains Power Automate nuggets that can ease your Microsoft 365 tasks.

I’m considered as a citizen developer and I know the ways to get some automation happening when it needed the most.
I will be mainly creating my automation with MS Graph API.

MS Graph API can perform tasks if you keen to go in that rabbit hole and once it’s combined with Power Automate? Magic. Well not really, but you can automate workflows and proven to be a must have set of tools in the Admin’s toolbox.

Please feel free to share, watch, notify me of any issues, improve or simply comment with what do you think that can be done differently to optimise the flows.

Thank you.
