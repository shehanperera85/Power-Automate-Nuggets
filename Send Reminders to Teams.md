# Send Reminders to Teams

**Goal of this flow:** My team mates have this practice of making our own Flat White coffees in the morning because that can save some money in the long run. Also re-usable coffee mug. So yeah why not?
We all chipped in for and have everyone’s round to bring a bag of coffee beans and in the morning we grind it and make coffee in this semi professional espresso maker.

Now the problem was because everyone is so busy, no one wants to keep a track of whos round was the last one and even though we tried many different manual methods, either the next person would not bring the beans at the right time or can’t remember whos round is next.
